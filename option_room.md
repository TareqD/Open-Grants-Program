## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project:
  OptionRoom is a user governed oracle and forecast protocol built on Polkadot.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  We're going to build the project on Substrate after successfully launching on the Ethereum network. Our on-chain governance will be implemented on polkadot
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We want to add value to the crypto and Polkadot ecosystem by implementing a prediction market protocol with user incentives and filling gaps in the current oracle solutions available by introducing an oracle as a service solution where oracle requests are solved by governance.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Our whitepaper, contains documentation of core components and all the detailed struture of our project.
OptionRoom Whitepaper: https://github.com/OptionRoom/OptionRoom-Whitepaper/blob/main/OptionRoom_Whitepaper.pdf

### Ecosystem Fit 
Our project has 2 main components:
* Oracle:
    Oracle: Our approach to the oracle is based on community voting and does not require any external data sources to acquire data, its completely community based (human oracle). We can complement the other oracles by supplying data they can’t access, such as certain types of verification (news, insurance claims).
* Forecast Market:
    Forecast Market: Currently there are a few forecast market projects on the market but most of them have failed to acquire an active user-base and community. We want to add value to the Polkadot ecosystem by introducing a truly limitless forecast market protocol where the forecast marketplace is governed by the community. The choices and markets are not limited to a certain structure, and initially verified by our governance to make sure we only list high quality markets. Our incentive mechanism will ensure that our honest protocol participants are rewarded and bad actors are punished. All the protocol fees go back to the protocol in form of buy-back mechanisms providing a sustainable long-term incentive model. We aim to make the forecast market creation and participation easy, intuitive and seamless by putting heavy resources into UI/UX development.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

ROOM is planned to be unlocked and trade-able in January 2021. OptionRoom is planning to launch COURT mining in March 2021. Protocol launch is scheduled to be in early Q2 2021 on Etherium in addition to smart contract audits and reward reduction phase. OptionRoom is planned to be ported to Polkadot in Q3/Q4 2021 depending on the timeline of synthetic asset solutions in the Polkadot ecosystem.

* **Q1 2021:

* **Q3 2022:
* Polkadot integration
* Protocol launch v2 On Polkadot

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 5 Months
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTE
* **Total Costs:** 50k DAI

### Milestone 1: Porting the OptionRoom protocol to polkadot
* **Estimated Duration:** 3 months
* **FTE:**  3
* **Costs:** 30k DAI

## Future Plans
We aim to retain and grow our current community base while having them honestly participate in our protocol. We aim to develop and explore more product launches on the OptionRoom protocol such as polls, dispute resolution mechanisms, decentralised surveys and curated lists - these all fall under current ground base of OptionRoom’s architecture.
