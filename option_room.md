## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project:
  OptionRoom is a user governed oracle and forecast protocol built on Polkadot.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  We're going to build the project on Substrate after successfully launching on the Ethereum network. Our on-chain governance will be implemented on polkadot
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  We found something that can add value to the crypto space and a unique approach to the oracle, and we're very eager to make it happen. 

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* We are going to provide our whitepaper, it contains documentation of core components and all the detailed struture of our project.
* Whitepaper Can be found at: 
https://github.com/OptionRoom/OptionRoom-Whitepaper/blob/main/OptionRoom_Whitepaper.pdf

### Ecosystem Fit 
Our project has 2 main components:
* Oracle:
    Our approach to the oracle is based on community voting and does not require any external data sources to acquire data, its completely community based (human oracle). We can complement the other oracles by supplying data they cant access, 
    such as certain types of verification (news, insurance claims). 
* Forecast Market:
    There are a few forecast market projects on the market, and we add value in this arena by providing a truly limitless forecast market protocol, where the choices and markets are not limited to a certain structure, 
    and initially verified by our governance to make sure we only list high quality markets. In addition to that, we have a solid user incentive program that includes a buy-back mechanism which with enough protocol 
    usage allows for reward generation without having to mint extra tokens, and this gives the opportunity of a sustainable long-term reward program.
